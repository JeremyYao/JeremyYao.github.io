    "About",
    "As a fourth year computer science student, one of the facets of computer science that intrigues me is how interdisplinary and applicable these skills are to any project and team. I am eager to work with individuals from all walks of life to not only better my skills as a computer scientist, but as an individual on planet Earth."
