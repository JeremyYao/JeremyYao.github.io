    "About",
    "I am a software engineer currently working on embedded systems, but have prior experience in web development, IT, and tutoring. Additionally, I graduated from Ohio State University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering with a 3.989 GPA. One of the facets of computer science that intrigues me is how interdisciplinary and applicable these skills are to any project and team. I am eager to work with individuals from all walks of life to not only better my skills as a well-rounded software engineer but also as an individual."

    "Career Path",
    "I started my journey in computer science early on: I received a Nintendo Gamecube gaming console at the age of 7-- I was hooked. I developed an interest in getting better at these games and figuring out how they work, developing an adaptable, detail-oriented mindset. Eventually, this curiosity led me to take a courseload emphasizing computer science throughout my academic career. Iâ€™ve also dabbled in extracurriculars and work experience such working in FIRST Robotics and Baja SAE teams and being a teaching assistant, teaching me about the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of computer science."
